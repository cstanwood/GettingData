#DATA DICTIONARY -- tiday.csv, based on Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set 
## Data summarized from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

This dataset is a summarized version of the data available at the web site listed above. The original data was obtained by reading measurements from a Samsung Galaxy SII, which the subjects were wearing while performing various routine activities.  

In the summarized dataset, only the means and standard deviations were selected, and then means were taken across multiple observations of the combinations of subject and activity (so the summarized dataset contains means of means, and means of standard deviations).  

To obtain the original data, the acclerometer in the Samsung device was used to obtain the acceleration, and the gyroscope was used to obtain angular velocity. 

According to the README.txt file in the original data, the accleration is measured with standard gravity units 'g', and the angular velocity is measured in radians/second. 

For further information, see the READMD.txt and features_info.txt files with the original dataset.
